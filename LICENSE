WHY AGPL-3.0?
================================================================================

The Planner's Assistant is licensed under AGPLv3 to ensure:

1. **Network Copyleft Protection**
   - Any modified version deployed as a web service MUST make source code 
     available to users
   - Prevents "SaaS loophole" where modifications are hidden behind APIs
   - Critical for public sector transparency and accountability

2. **Public Sector Alignment**
   - Planning decisions affect communities and must be auditable
   - Local Planning Authorities need to inspect and verify reasoning logic
   - Citizens have the right to understand automated planning recommendations

3. **Collaborative Improvement**
   - Forces commercial derivatives to contribute improvements back
   - Prevents proprietary forks that fragment the planning ecosystem
   - Encourages shared investment in public infrastructure

4. **Research & Academia**
   - Universities and research institutions can freely use, modify, and deploy
   - Published research must include reproducible source code
   - Supports open science in urban planning and AI-assisted governance

5. **Data Sovereignty**
   - Local authorities retain control over their planning data and policy logic
   - No vendor lock-in through proprietary extensions
   - Enables federated networks of planning authorities sharing improvements

================================================================================
